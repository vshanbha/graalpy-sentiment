# Sentiment Analysis Application

This project is a sentiment analysis application that provides an API for analyzing the sentiment of a given text. The application is built using Java with Spring Boot for the API and Python with the TextBlob library for performing sentiment analysis. [GraalPy](https://www.graalvm.org/python/) is used to embed the Python runtime inside Java. Full Project documentation available on the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/vshanbha/graalpy-sentiment/wiki)
